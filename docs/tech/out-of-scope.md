# Out of Scope

`Microbus`'s focus is on building and operating microservices at scale. The following areas are currently out of scope:

* __User interface__ - `Microbus` is a backend framework. Its link to the front-end are microservice endpoints that respond with JSON to single-page front-end applications, and an OpenAPI document that catalogs those endpoints. It is possible for microservices to generate HTML but `Microbus` provides no tooling in this area.
* __SDLC automation__ - Automating the SDLC of `Microbus` applications is currently out of scope. 
* __Databases__ - The choice of database depends heavily on the use case of the application. As an enabling technology, `Microbus` takes no sides and does not offer tooling in the areas of data access and processing.
* __AI__ - Artificial intelligence is currently out of scope.

Some of these areas have room for contributors to step in. Contact us if you want to [get involved](../../README.md#-get-involved).
