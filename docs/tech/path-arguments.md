# Path Arguments

## Fixed Path

In the typical case, endpoints of a microservice have fixed URLs at which they are reachable. Consider the following `service.yaml` specification.

```yaml
general:
  host: calculator.example

functions:
  - signature: Add(x int, y int) (sum int)
    description: Add adds two integers and returns their sum.
```

The `Add` endpoint is reachable at the internal `Microbus` URL of `https://calculator.example/add` or the external URL of `https://localhost:8080/calculator.example/add` assuming that the ingress proxy is listening at `localhost:8080`. The arguments `x` and `y` of the function are unmarshaled from the request query argument or from the body of the request.

```http
GET /add?x=5&y=5 HTTP/1.1
Host: calculator.example
```

```http
POST /add?x=5&y=5 HTTP/1.1
Host: calculator.example

{"x":5,"y":5}
```

## Variable Path

A fixed path is consistent with the [RPC over JSON](./rpcvsrest.md) style of API but is insufficient for implementing a [RESTful](./rpcvsrest.md) style of API where it is common to expect input arguments in the path of the request. This is where path arguments come into play.

Consider the following `service.yaml` specification that defines a path argument `{id}` and a corresponding function argument `id int`:

```yaml
general:
  host: articles.example

functions:
  - signature: Load(id int) (article *Article)
    description: Load looks for an article by its ID.
    path: //article/{id}
    method: GET
```

The `Load` endpoint is now reachable at the internal `Microbus` wildcard URL of `https://article/{id}` where `{id}` is expected to be an `int`. The argument `id` of the function is unmarshaled from the second part of the path because it shares the same name as the path argument.

```http
GET /1 HTTP/1.1
Host: article
```

## Greediness

A typical path argument only captures the data in one part of the path, i.e. between two `/`s in the path or after the last `/`. The values of these  arguments therefore cannot contain a `/`. However, multiple such path arguments may be defined in the path. 

```yaml
functions:
  - signature: LoadComment(articleID int, commentID int) (comment *Comment)
    description: LoadComment looks for a comment of an article by its ID.
    path: //article/{articleID}/comment/{commentID}
    method: GET
```

A greedy path argument on the other hand captures the remainder of the path and can span multiple parts of the path and include `/`s. A greedy path argument must be the last element in the path specification. Greedy path arguments are denoted using a `+` in their definition, e.g. `{greedy+}`.

```yaml
functions:
  - signature: LoadFile(category int, filePath string) (data []byte)
    description: LoadFile looks for a file by its path.
    path: //file/{category}/{filePath+}
    method: GET
```

## Unnamed Arguments

Path arguments that are left unnamed are automatically given the names `path1`, `path2` etc. in order of their appearance. In the following example, the three unnamed path arguments are named `path1`, `path2` and `path3`. It is recommended to name path arguments and avoid this ambiguity.

```yaml
functions:
  - signature: UnnamedPathArguments(path1 int, path2 int, path3 string) (ok bool)
    description: UnnamedPathArguments demonstrates unnamed arguments.
    path: /foo/{}/bar/{}/greedy/{+}
    method: GET
```

## Conflicts

Path arguments are a form of wildcard subscription and might overlap if not crafted carefully. In the following case, requests to `/hello/world` will alternate between the two handlers and will result in unpredictable behavior.

```yaml
functions:
  - signature: CatchAll(suffix string) (ok bool)
    description: CatchAll catches all requests.
    path: /{suffix+}
    method: GET
  - signature: Hello(name string) (n int)
    description: Hello's subscription is a subset of CatchAll's.
    path: /hello/{name}
    method: GET
```

## Web Handlers

Path arguments work also for web handlers but they must be parsed manually from the request's path. Consider the following example of a web handler:

```yaml
web:
  - signature: AvatarImage()
    description: AvatarImage serves the avatar image of the user.
    path: /avatar/{uid}/{size}/{name+}
    method: GET
```

```go
func (svc *Service) AvatarImage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) (err error) {
    // Path arguments must be manually extracted from the path
    parts := strings.Split(r.URL.Path, "/") // ["", "avatar", "{uid}", "{size}", "{name}", "..."]
    uid = parts[2]
    size = parts[3]
    name = strings.Join(parts[4:], "/")

    return serveImage(uid, size)
}
```

## Pervasive Routing

Path arguments are not recommended for pervasive (non-load balanced) endpoints, events or sinks. Using path arguments in these cases will result in significantly slow response times because they interfere with an optimization that relies on a fixed URL pattern.

```yaml
functions:
  - signature: NotAGoodIdea(id int) (ok bool)
    description: NotAGoodIdea mixes a path argument with pervasive routing.
    path: /data/{id}
    queue: none
```
