# Quick Start

## Clone the Project

Fetch the code:

```cmd
mkdir github.com/microbus-io
cd github.com/microbus-io
git clone https://github.com/microbus-io/fabric
```

Note: it is recommended to clone the code into a directory structure that mirrors the package structure.

## Setup and Run the Development Environment

The `Microbus` framework depends on a few third-party services:

* NATS is a hard requirement used as the communication transport between microservice
* Prometheus is an optional service that can be used to collect metrics from `Microbus` microservices
* Grafana is an optional service that can visualize metrics collected by Prometheus
* Jaeger is an optional service that can visualize distributed tracing spans

Use `docker compose` from within the `setup` directory to install the above and set up the development environment.

```cmd
cd setup
docker compose -f microbus.yaml -p microbus up
```

Docker Desktop should now show the `microbus` application:

## Run the Examples

Run the example app:

```cmd
cd examples/main
go run main.go
```

It is necessary to set the working directory to `examples/main` so that the file `examples/main/config.yaml` can be located.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, simply press `F5`. The `.vscode/launch.json` file includes a launch configuration for running `examples/main`.

Try the following URLs in your browser:

* http://localhost:8080/calculator.example/arithmetic?x=5&op=*&y=8
* http://localhost:8080/calculator.example/square?x=5
* http://localhost:8080/calculator.example/square?x=not-a-number
* http://localhost:8080/calculator.example/distance?p1.x=0&p1.y=0&p2.x=3&p2.y=4
* http://localhost:8080/hello.example/echo
* http://localhost:8080/hello.example/ping
* http://localhost:8080/hello.example/hello?name=Bella

* http://localhost:8080/messaging.example/home
* http://localhost:8080/messaging.example/cache-store?key=foo&value=bar
* http://localhost:8080/messaging.example/cache-load?key=foo
* http://localhost:8080/browser.example/browse?url=example.com
* http://localhost:8080/directory.example/web-ui?method=POST&path=/persons&body=%7B%22firstName%22:%22Harry%22,%22lastName%22:%22Potter%22,%22email%22:%22hp@hogwarts.edu%22%7D (push submit to perform the POST request)
* http://localhost:8080/directory.example/persons
* http://localhost:8080/directory.example/persons/key/1
* http://localhost:8080/directory.example/web-ui?method=DELETE&path=/persons/key/1 (push submit to perform the DELETE request)

Feel free to experiment with different values for the query arguments.

To view the metrics collected by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), go to http://localhost:9090/graph. As an example, you may execute the query `microbus_uptime_duration_seconds_total`.

To view the same metrics in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards, go to http://localhost:3000 and login using the credentials `admin`:`admin`.

To view the distributed traces in [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), go to http://localhost:16686.

## Configure IDE

The [Todo Tree extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) is recommended for VS Code users.
