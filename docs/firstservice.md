# First Microservice Walk-Through

This guide walks through the creation of a microservice that implements a simplified version of a word guessing game. The player needs to reveal a secret 5-letter word by entering limited number of guesses while observing how closely they match the secret word.

For example, if the secret word is `APPLE` and a guess is `OPERA`, the system will identify the second letter `P` as an exact match (green), the letters `A` and `E` as out-of-place matches (yellow), and the letters `O` and `R` as non-matches (grey).

<div style="background:grey;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">O</div>
<div style="background:green;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">P</div>
<div style="background:#DBA800;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">E</div>
<div style="background:grey;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">R</div>
<div style="background:#DBA800;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">A</div>
<p>

## Step 1: Bootstrap

To get started, create a directory under `examples` to house the microservice files. We'll call our game `Wordly` so name the directory `examples/wordly`.

Next, create a new source file `doc.go` and place in it the `go:generate` directive and package name.

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/microbus-io/fabric/codegen

package wordly
```

From within the directory, run `go generate`.

```cmd
cd examples/wordly
go generate
```

A `service.yaml` template is generated. We'll fill it in next.

## Step 2: Service Definition

Open `service.yaml`. This is you starting point and where you define the structure of the microservice. First, name the service:

```yaml
general:
  host: wordly.example
  description: Wordly is a word guessing game.
```

`Wordly` is a simple game and it requires a single endpoint `/play`. We'll use a `web` handler because we want to create an HTML interface.

```yaml
webs:
  - signature: Play()
    description: Play a game of Wordly.
```

Finally, we'll want to control the maximum number of guesses using a config.

```yaml
configs:
  - signature: MaxGuesses() (max int)
    description: MaxGuesses to guess the secret word.
    default: 6
    validation: int [1,]
```

Run `go generate` again to generate the boilerplate code. You'll see quite a few files created in the `examples/wordly` directory. We will mostly touch `service.go`.

## Step 3: Keeping Track of Games

Open `service.go`. You'll see a type definition for the `Service` struct and 3 empty functions: the standard lifecycle callbacks `OnStartup` and `OnShutdown`, and the endpoint `Play` that you defined in `service.yaml`.

We'd like our microservice to serve many users at the same time so we're going to have to track multiple games in parallel. The structure `Game` will maintain the status of a game.

```go
type Game struct {
    secretWord string
    guesses []string
}
```

A `map[string]*Game` will keep track of all games indexed by an ID.

```go
type Service struct {
	*intermediate.Intermediate // DO NOT REMOVE

	games map[string]*Game
}
```

This map needs to be initialized in `OnStartup`.

```go
func (svc *Service) OnStartup(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
	svc.games = map[string]*Game{}
	return nil
}
```

## Step 4: Implementation

We'll implement the logic of the game in the `Play` method which represents the `GET /play` request. This endpoint accepts two optional query arguments. The first, `game`, identifies the game. If it is not present, a new game is created. Add the following code to `Play`.

```go
gameID := r.URL.Query().Get("game")
game := svc.games[gameID]
if gameID == "" || game == nil {
    gameID = rand.AlphaNum64(12)
    game = &Game{
        secretWord: "APPLE",
    }
    svc.games[gameID] = game
}
```

The secret word is hard-coded to `APPLE` for the time being. We'll get to it later.

The second argument is `guess` which, if present, submits a guess to the identified game. Add the following code to `Play`.

```go
guess := r.URL.Query().Get("guess")
guess = strings.ToUpper(guess)
re := regexp.MustCompile("[A-Z]{5}")
if guess != "" && !re.MatchString(guess) {
    return errors.New("invalid guess")
}
if guess != "" && len(game.guesses) < svc.MaxGuesses() {
    game.guesses = append(game.guesses, guess)
}
```

Notice the use of `svc.MaxGuesses()` to pull the value of the config property that you defined earlier in `service.yaml`.

Next, we'll render the UI. First, a simple form to submit a guess,

<input type="text" maxlength="5">
<input type="button" value="Guess">
<p>

```go
var page bytes.Buffer
page.WriteString(`<html><body>`)

page.WriteString(`
    <form method="GET">
        <input type="text" name="guess" maxlength="5">
        <input type="hidden" name="game" value="` + gameID + `">
        <input type="submit" value="Guess">
    </form><p>
`)
```

then all prior guesses and with indication of their level of matching of the secret word.

<div style="background:grey;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">W</div>
<div style="background:#DBA800;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">R</div>

<div style="background:#DBA800;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">G</div>
<p>

<div style="background:green;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">R</div>
<div style="background:green;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">I</div>

<div style="background:green;color:white;display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">T</div>
<p>

```go
for _, g := range game.guesses {
    secret := []rune(game.secretWord)
    word := []rune(g)
    colors := make([]string, 5)
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        colors[i] = "grey"
    }
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        if word[i] == secret[i] {
            colors[i] = "green"
            word[i] = 0
            secret[i] = 0
        }
    }
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        if word[i] == 0 {
            continue
        }
        for j := 0; j < 5; j++ {
            if secret[j] == 0 {
                continue
            }
            if word[i] == secret[j] {
                colors[i] = "#DBA800"
                word[i] = 0
                secret[j] = 0
                break
            }
        }
    }
    word = []rune(g)
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        page.WriteString(`<div style="background:` + colors[i] + `;color:white;`)
        page.WriteString(`display:inline-block;font-size:24pt;width:32pt;text-align:center;">`)
        page.WriteRune(word[i])
        page.WriteString(`</div>`)
    }
    page.WriteString(`<p>`)
}

page.WriteString(`</body></html>`)

w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
w.Write(page.Bytes())
return nil  
```

## Step 4: Randomized Secret Word

In the prior step we hard-coded the word `APPLE` as the secret word. We need to randomize it but we can't just generate it from random letters because that will result in unguessable gibberish. Instead, we'll choose a word randomly from a list of real dictionary words.

The `resources` folder allows us to embed resource files with the microservice. Create a new file `words.txt` in `examples/wordly/resources` and fill it with the following list of words. Remove any trailing spaces or newlines at the end of the file.

```

With `svc.Resources()`, it's a simple matter of choosing a random word from the resource.

```go
func (svc *Service) randomWord() string {
	binary, _ := svc.Resources().ReadFile("words.txt")
	words := strings.Split(string(binary), " ")
	return strings.ToUpper(words[rand.Intn(len(words))])
}
```

And finally, adjusting the new game generation.

```go
game = &Game{
    secretWord: svc.randomWord(),
}
```

## Step 5: Time to Play!

Include the new microservice in the app in `examples/main/main.go` and run it using `go run` or your IDE.

```go
func main() {
	app := application.New(
		configurator.NewService(),
		httpingress.NewService(),
		hello.NewService(),
		messaging.NewService(),
		messaging.NewService(),
		messaging.NewService(),
		calculator.NewService(),
		wordly.NewService(), // <-- Add
	)
	app.Run()
}
```

Go to http://localhost:8080/wordly.example/play and enjoy!

Wanna make the game harder by decreasing the number of guesses? Change the value of the config property `MaxGuesses` by editing the `examples/main/config.yaml`.

```yaml
wordly.example:
  MaxGuesses: 5
```

## Step 6: Extra Credit

This microservice is far from being polished. Try the following on your own:

* Add a title to the top of the page
* Add instructions that mention how many guesses the player has left
* Give a cleaner error message to the user on an invalid guess
* Do not print the guessing form if the player exhausted all of their guesses
* Do not accept guesses after the player identified the secret word
* Accept guesses only if they are themselves valid words
* Support 4, 6 and 7 letter words
