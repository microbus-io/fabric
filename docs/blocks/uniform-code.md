# Uniform Code Structure

The code generator creates numerous files and sub-directories in the directory of the microservice.

```
{name}
  app
    {name}
      main-gen.go
  {name}api
    clients-gen.go
    imports-gen.go
    type.go
  intermediate
    intermediate-gen.go
    mock-gen.go
  resources
    embed-gen.go
  integration_test.go
  integration-gen_test.go
  service-gen.go
  service.go
  version-gen_test.go
  version-gen.go
```

Files that include `-gen` in their name are fully code generated and should not be edited. The are also marked with a `DO NOT EDIT` comment.

The `app` directory hosts `package main` of an `Application` that runs the microservice, and only the microservice. This is what eventually gets built and deployed. The executable will be named like the package name of the microservice.

The `{service}api` directory (and package) defines the `Client` and `MulticastClient` of the microservice and the complex types (structs) that they use. `MulticastTrigger` and `Hook` are defined if the microservice is a source of events. Together these represent the public-facing API of the microservice to upstream microservices. The name of the directory is derived from that of the microservice in order to make it easily distinguishable in code completion tools.

The `intermediate` directory (and package) defines the `Intermediate` and the `Mock`. The `Intermediate` serves as the base of the microservice via anonymous inclusion and in turn extends the [`Connector`](../structure/connector.md). The `Mock` is a mockable stub of the microservices that can be used in [integration testing](../blocks/integrationtesting.md) when a live version of the microservice cannot.

`integration-gen_test.go` is a testing harness that facilitates the implementation of integration tests, which are expected to be implemented in `integration_test.go`

The `resources` directory is a place to put static files to be embedded (linked) into the executable of the microservice. Templates, images, scripts, etc. are some examples of what can potentially be embedded.

`service-gen.go` primarily includes the function to create a `NewService`.

`service.go` is where application developers are expected to introduce the business logic of the microservice. `service.go` implements `Service`, which extends `Intermediate` as mentioned earlier. Most of the tools that a microservice needs are available through the receiver `(svc *Service)` which points to the `Intermediate` and by extension the `Connector`. It include the methods of the `Connector` as well as type-specific methods defined in the `Intermediate`.

```go
type Intermediate struct {
    *connector.Connector
}

type Service struct {
    *intermediate.Intermediate
}

func (svc *Service) DoSomething(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
    // svc points to the Intermediate and by extension the Connector
}
```

In addition to the standard `OnStartup` and `OnShutdown` callbacks, the code generator creates an empty function in `service.go` for each and every web handler, functional handler, event sink, ticker or config change callback defined in `service.yaml` as described earlier.

```go
// OnStartup is called when the microservice is started up.
func (svc *Service) OnStartup(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
    return
}

// OnShutdown is called when the microservice is shut down.
func (svc *Service) OnShutdown(ctx context.Context) (err error) {
    return
}
```

`version-gen.go` holds the SHA256 of the source code and the auto-incremented version number. `version-gen_test.go` makes sure it is up to date. If the test fails, running `go generate` brings the version up to date.
