# Configuration

It's quite common for microservices to want to define properties whose values can be configured without code changes, often by non-engineers. Connection strings to a database, number of rows to display in a table, a timeout value, are all examples of configuration properties.

In `Microbus`, the microservice owns the definition of its config properties, while [the configurator core microservice owns their values](../structure/coreservices-configurator.md). The former means that microservices are self-descriptive and independent, which is important in a distributed development environment. The latter means that managing configuration values and pushing them to a live system are centrally controlled, which is important because configs can contain secrets and because pushing the wrong config values can destabilize a deployment.

Configuration properties must first be defined by the microservice using `DefineConfig`. In the following example, the property is named `Foo` and given the default value `Bar` and a regexp requirement that the value is comprised of at least one letter and only letters. The case-insensitive property name is required. Various [options](../structure/cfg.md) allow setting a default value, enforcing validation, and more.

```go
con.New("www.example.com")
con.DefineConfig("Foo", cfg.DefaultValue("Bar"), cfg.Validation("str ^[A-Za-z]+$"))
```

Immediately upon startup, the microservice contacts the configurator microservice to ask for the values of its configuration properties. If an override value is available at the configurator, it is set as the new value of the config property; otherwise, the default value of the config property is set instead.

Configs are accessed using the `Config` method of the `Connector`. 

```go
foo := con.Config("Foo")
```

The microservice keeps listening for a command on the [control subscription](./controlsubs.md) `:888/config-refresh` and will respond by refetching config values from the configurator. The configurator issues this command on startup and on a periodic basis (every 20 minutes) to ensure that all microservices always have the latest config. If new values are received by the microservice, they will be set appropriately and the `OnConfigChanged` callback will be invoked.

```go
con.SetOnConfigChanged(func (ctx context.Context, changed func(string) bool) error {
	if changed("Foo") {
		con.LogInfo(ctx, "Foo changed", log.String("to", con.Config("Foo")))
	}
	return nil
})
```

Note that the fetching config values from the configurator is disabled in the `TESTING` deployment environment.

Config values can be set programmatically using `SetConfig`, however such values will be overridden on the next fetch of config from the configurator. It is advisable to limit use of this action to testing scenarios when fetching values from the configurator is disabled.
