# Package `examples`

The `examples` package holds several examples that demonstrate how the framework can be used to create microservices. When studying an example, start by looking at the `service.yaml` to get a quick overview of the functionality of the microservice. Then go deep into the code in `service.go`. All files with `-gen` in their name are code generated and can be ignored until you're ready to go deep into the internals of `Microbus`.

* [Hello](../structure/examples-hello.md) demonstrates the key capabilities of the framework
* [Calculator](../structure/examples-calculator.md) demonstrates functional handlers
* [Messaging](../structure/examples-messaging.md) demonstrates load-balanced unicast, multicast and direct addressing messaging
* [Event source and sink](../structure/examples-events.md) shows how events can be used to reverse the dependency between two microservices
* [Directory](../structure/examples-directory.md) is an example of a microservice that provides a CRUD API backed by a database
* [Browser](../structure/examples-browser.md) is an example of a microservice that uses the [HTTP egress core microservice](../structure/coreservices-httpegress.md)

In case you missed it, the [quick start guide](../howto/quick-start.md) explains how to setup your system to run the examples.
