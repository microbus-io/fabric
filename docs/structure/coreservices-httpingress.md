# Package `coreservices/httpingress`

The [HTTP ingress proxy](../blocks/http-ingress.md) bridges the gap between the browser (or any HTTP client for that matter) and the microservices running on top of NATS. To achieve that, the ingress proxy is listening to HTTP requests on one end, and on the other connects to the NATS network.
