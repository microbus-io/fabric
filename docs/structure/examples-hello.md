# Package `examples/hello`

The `hello.example` microservice demonstrates some of the key capabilities of the framework using various endpoints.

`/echo` echos the incoming HTTP request in text format. This is a useful tool for looking at the HTTP control headers `Microbus-` added by the framework.

http://localhost:8080/hello.example/echo produces:

```http

The `/ping` endpoint broadcasts a ping to discover the identity of all microservices running on the cluster.

```
bvtgii68r8.messaging.example
mv2pcoockl.messaging.example
r52l78kha4.messaging.example
pa6r5ohm5h.hello.example
0iij3m5fhf.http.ingress.sys
7k9f82n45f.configurator.sys
n89hmtb9iq.calculator.example
```

The `/hello` endpoint renders a simple greeting. It demonstrates the use of configs as well as taking in arguments from the URL. The single endpoint `/hello` takes in a query argument `name` and prints the greeting specified in the `Greeting` config, repeated as many times as indicate by the `Repeat` config. The values of these configs are set in `examples/main/env.yaml`.

http://localhost:8080/hello.example/hello?name=Bella prints:

```
Ciao, Bella!
Ciao, Bella!
Ciao, Bella!
```

The `/calculator` endpoint renders a rudimentary UI of a calculator. Behind the scenes, this endpoint calls the `calculator.example/arithmetic` endpoint to perform the calculation itself, demonstrating service-to-service calls. The `calculator.example` microservice is discussed next.

The `/bus.jpeg` endpoint serves an image from the embedded resources directory.
