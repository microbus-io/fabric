package sqlschema

/*
SQL files places in this directory are executed during database initialization.
Each SQL script is executed only once, in order of the number in its file name.
Files must be named 1.sql, 2.sql, etc.
A script may contain multiple statements separated by a semi-colon that is followed by a new line.

Typical schema definition and migration use cases:

	CREATE TABLE persons (
		tenant_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
		id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		name VARCHAR(256) CHARACTER SET ascii NOT NULL,
		created DATETIME(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(3),
		PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, person_id),
		INDEX(id),
		INDEX idx_name (name ASC)
	)

	ALTER TABLE persons
		DROP COLUMN created,
		ADD COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(128) CHARACTER SET ascii NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
		ADD COLUMN last_name VARCHAR(128) CHARACTER SET ascii NOT NULL DEFAULT ''

	CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON persons (last_name ASC)
