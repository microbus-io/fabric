## üöå Introduction

`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages NATS, a messaging bus, for communications among microservices. Microservices over a bus = microbus.

The framework's philosophy can be categorized into three conceptual areas:

* Common runtime - The framework specifies rules that all microservices need to comply with during runtime. This includes things like how microservices [communicate](./docs/tech/unicast.md), how they report [metrics](./docs/structure/coreservices-metrics.md), where they [pull config values](./docs/tech/configuration.md) from, how they output logs, how they get deployed, etc. A common set of rules is important for interoperability, maintainability and stability of the system
* RAD tools - The framework leverages [code generation](./docs/tech/codegen.md) for the rapid development of microservices with the intent that application developers focus on the business logic rather than on boilerplate code. Developer productivity is directly correlated to customer value
* Standard building blocks - Capabilities that are deemed to be the building blocks of microservices are implemented by the framework in a standard way, serving to facilitate both of the above

`fabric` is the main project that provides the basic capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices are built upon. The [milestones](./docs/milestones.md) of this project are maintained in separate branches in order to archive and demonstrate the development process of the framework and the evolution of the codebase.

## üö¶ Getting Started

üëâ Follow the [quick start guide](./docs/quick-start.md) to set up your system and run the example app.

üëâ Go through the [examples](./docs/structure/examples.md) in depth.

üëâ Follow the step-by-step guide and [build your first microservice](./docs/first-service.md)!

üëâ Discover the full power of [code generation](./docs/tech/codegen.md). It's totally RAD, dude!

üëâ Learn how to write thorough [integration tests](./docs/tech/integrationtesting.md) and achieve high code coverage.

üëâ Venture out and [explore more on your own](./docs/self-explore.md).

## üßÖ Layers

Onions have layers, ogres have layers, and so does any decent software architecture.

`Microbus` is conceptually divisible into 4 layers, each providing a set of building blocks (capabilities) to the microservices.

* At the bottom of the `Microbus` stack is a curated selection of OSS technologies that are utilized and abstracted away by the next layer, the connector
* The [connector](./docs/structure/connector.md) construct is the base class from which all microservices are derived. It provides a consistent API to many of the building blocks that are required for a microservice to operate and mesh with other microservices. More often than not, they rely on OSS under the hood
* A [code generator](./docs/tech/codegen.md) brings type-safe RAD that is specific to the semantics of each individual microservice
* The core microservices and the application microservices are built using the code generator

Each of the building blocks is described below the diagram.

### OSS

[NATS](https://www.nats.io) sits at the core of `Microbus` and makes much of its magic possible. NATS is a full-mesh, highly-available, lighting-fast, real-time, at-most-once, messaging bus. It enables request/response, publish/subscribe, load-balancing, discovery and geo affinity routing.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is a standard for the collection of metrics, distributed tracing and logs.

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) is a distributed tracing observability platform that maps the flow of requests as they traverse a distributed system such as `Microbus`. It is an implementation of the OpenTelemetry standards.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a database for storing highly-dimensional time-series data, specifically system and application-level metrics.

[Grafana](https://grafana.com) is a dashboard that provides visibility into the metrics collected by Prometheus.

[Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) is a high-performance, structured (JSON), leveled logger.

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) is a widely used API description standard. The endpoints of all microservices on `Microbus` are publicly described with OpenAPI.

[Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) is a Go library that helps with making assertions in unit and integration tests.

[Cascadia](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia) implements CSS selectors for use with parsing HTML trees produced by Go's `html` package. Used in unit and integration tests, it facilitates assertions against an HTML document.
