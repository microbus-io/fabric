## üöå Introduction

A microservice architecture is essential for unleashing the full potential of a business as it scales. Without such architecture, the complexity of the codebase will grow to a point where the engineering team can no longer innovate and collaborate efficiently. In most likelihood the entire application will have to be rewritten at a critical point of the business - when it is growing rapidly - and at a prohibitive cost. Investing in microservices from the get-go (no pun intended) is a wise investment that mitigates this upside risk.

Building and operating microservices at scale, however, is very difficult and beyond the skills of most engineering teams. It's easy to spin up one web server and call it a microservice but things get exponentially more complicated the more microservices are added to the mix. Many teams at some point either call it quits and stop adding microservices, or introduce complex tooling such as service meshes to help manage the complexity. Adding complexity to solve complexity is a self-defeating strategy: the chickens eventually come home to roost.

`Microbus` thinks differently. By taking a novel approach to the development, testing, deployment and troubleshooting of microservices, it eliminates much of the complexity of the current state of the art. `Microbus` is a holistic framework that packages together various OSS technologies, tooling, best practices, patterns and guides into a cohesive engineering experience that elevates developer productivity 4x.

`Microbus` is the culmination of a decade of research and has been successfully battle-tested in production settings running SaaS applications comprising many dozens of microservices.

## üê∂ Dogma

These core tenets were top of mind in the design of `Microbus`.

### Elevated Engineering Experience

`Microbus` includes tooling, guides, patterns and best practices that facilitate rapid application development (RAD), thorough testing and pinpoint troubleshooting. Increase engineering velocity and deliver more value to your customers faster.

* Run, test and debug an entire application comprising a multitude of microservices in your IDE
* Speed up development with code generation of boilerplate code
* Observe your system with pinpoint accuracy to troubleshoot and optimize your code, while building or in production

[Learn more](./docs/dogma/eee.md) about elevating the engineering experience

### Adaptive Deployment Topology

From a local development machine to a multi-region cloud deployment with geo-aware failover, `Microbus` grows with your needs. No code changes required.

* Deploy as a resilient modular monolith, or a multi-region cloud deployment with geo-aware failover
* Run as a standalone executable or on Kubernetes
* Include one or many microservices in each executable or pod

[Learn more](./docs/dogma/topology.md) about adaptive topologies

### Simplified OSS Tech Stack

`Microbus` is powered by a small curated set of OSS technologies integrated to work together in unison and exposed through a simplified API that keeps the learning curve short and operational complexity low.

* Get up to speed quickly by virtue of a short learning curve and resonable defaults
* Keep the number of moving parts small and control operational complexity
* Rely on a chef's choice of best in class OSS

[Learn more](./docs/dogma/oss.md) about the tech stack

### Scalable, Resilient and Performant

Components at all levels of `Microbus`, from the application microservices down to the messaging bus, can be scaled horizontally. No single points of failure or bottlenecks.

* Scale your system horizontally as your requirements grow
* Serve thousands of requests per second on a single machine
* Rest assured knowing that your code is running on top of a robust thoroughly-tested runtime

[Learn more](./docs/dogma/scalable.md) about horizontal scalability

### Robust Runtime

All microservices running on `Microbus` comply with the same set of rules, guaranteeing smooth interoperability, straightforward maintainability and verifiable stability.

* Observe every detail of interaction between microservices
* Benefit from advanced patterns such as distributed caching, time budgets and acks
* Use the inherent publish/subscribe communication pattern for an event-driven architecture

[Learn more](./docs/dogma/runtime.md) about the common runtime
