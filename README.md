`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages a messaging bus for the transport layer. Microservices over a bus = microbus.

[![Test](https://github.com/microbus-io/fabric/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/microbus-io/fabric/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

## Introduction

The framework's philosophy can be categorized into three conceptual areas:

* Common runtime - The framework specifies rules that all microservices need to comply with during runtime. This includes things like how microservices [communicate](./docs/tech/unicast.md), how they report [metrics](./docs/structure/coreservices-metrics.md), where they [pull config values](./docs/blocks/configuration.md) from, how they output logs, how they get deployed, etc. A common set of rules is important for interoperability, maintainability and stability of the system
* RAD tools - The framework leverages [code generation](./docs/blocks/codegen.md) for the rapid development of microservices with the intent that application developers focus on the business logic rather than on boilerplate code. Developer productivity is directly correlated to customer value
* Standard building blocks - Capabilities that are deemed to be the building blocks of microservices are implemented by the framework in a standard way, serving to facilitate both of the above

`fabric` is the main project that provides the basic capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices are built upon. The [milestones](./docs/milestones.md) of this project are maintained in separate branches in order to archive and demonstrate the development process of the framework and the evolution of the codebase.
