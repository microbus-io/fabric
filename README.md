`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages a messaging bus as the transport layer. Microservices over a bus = microbus.

Build, test, deploy, run and operate microservices, simpler, faster, smarter and at scale.

## Introduction

Building and operating microservices at scale is very difficult. It's easy to spin up one web server and call it a microservice but things get exponentially more complicated the more microservices are added to the mix. Many teams at this point either call it quits and stop adding microservices, or introduce complex tooling such as service meshes to help manage the complexity. Adding complexity to solve complexity is a self-defeating strategy: the chickens will eventually come home to roost.

`Microbus` thinks differently. By taking a novel approach to the development, testing, deployment and troubleshooting of microservices, it eliminates much of the complexity of the current state of the art. `Microbus` is a holistic framework that packages together various OSS technologies, tooling, best practices, patterns and guides into a cohesive engineering experience that elevates developer productivity 4x.

`Microbus` is the culmination of a decade of research and has been successfully battle-tested in a production setting.


## Dogma

These core tenets were top of mind in the design of `Microbus`.

### Elevated Engineering Experience

`Microbus` includes tooling, guides, patterns and best practices that facilitate rapid application development (RAD), thorough testing and precision troubleshooting.

### Simplified Omakase OSS Tech Stack

`Microbus` is powered by a small curated set of OSS technologies integrated to work together in unison and exposed through a simplified API that keeps the learning curve short and operational complexity low.

### Scalability, Reliability and Performance

Components at all levels of `Microbus`, from the application microservices down to the messaging bus, can be scaled horizontally. No single points of failure or bottlenecks.

### Common Runtime Rulebook

All microservices running on `Microbus` comply with the same set of rules, guaranteeing smooth interoperability, straightforward maintainability and verifiable stability.

### Adaptive Deployment Topology

From a local development machine to a multi-region cloud deployment with geo-aware failover, `Microbus` grows with your needs. No code changes required.
