## üöå Introduction

`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages NATS, a messaging bus, for communications among microservices. Microservices over a bus = microbus.

The framework's philosophy touches on three conceptual areas:

* Common runtime - The framework specifies rules that all microservices need to comply with during runtime. This includes things like how microservices [communicate](docs/tech/unicast.md), how they report [metrics](docs/structure/services-metrics.md), where they [pull config values](docs/tech/configuration.md) from, how they get deployed, etc. A common set of rules is important for interoperability, maintainability and stability of the system
* RAD tools - The framework leverages [code generation](docs/tech/codegen.md) for the rapid development of microservices with the intent that application developers focus on the business logic rather than on boilerplate code. Developer productivity is directly correlated to customer value
* Standard building blocks - Capabilities that are deemed to be the building blocks of microservices are implemented by the framework in a standard way, serving to facilitate both of the above

`fabric` is the main project that provides the core capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices are built on. The [milestones](docs/milestones.md) of this project are maintained in separate branches in order to demonstrate the thinking process behind the building of this framework.

## üö¶ Getting Started

üëâ Follow the [quick start guide](docs/quick-start.md) ‚ú® to set up your system and run the example app.

üëâ Go through the [examples](docs/structure/examples.md) in depth.

üëâ Follow the step-by-step guide and [build your first microservice](docs/first-service.md)!

üëâ Discover the full power of [code generation](docs/tech/codegen.md). It's totally RAD, dude!

üëâ Learn how to write thorough [integration tests](docs/tech/integrationtesting.md) and achieve high code coverage.

üëâ Venture out and [explore more on your own](docs/self-explore.md).

## üó∫ Code Structure

Review each of the major project packages to get oriented in the code structure:

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technical Deep Dive

Go deep into the philosophy and implementation of `Microbus`:

* [Unicast messaging](docs/tech/unicast.md) - Unicast enables bi-directional (request and response) HTTP-like messaging between a client and a single server over NATS
* [HTTP ingress](docs/tech/httpingress.md) - The reason for and role of the HTTP ingress proxy service
* [Encapsulation pattern](docs/tech/encapsulation.md) - The reasons for encapsulating third-party technologies
* [Error capture](docs/tech/errorcapture.md) - How and why errors are captured and propagated across microservices boundaries
* [Time budget](docs/tech/timebudget.md) - The proper way to manage request timeouts
* [Configuration](docs/tech/configuration.md) - How to configure microservices
* [NATS connection settings](docs/tech/natsconnection.md) - How to configure microservices to connect and authenticate to NATS
* [Multicast messaging](docs/tech/multicast.md) - Extending on the unicast pattern, multicast enables bi-directional (request and response) HTTP-like messaging between a client and multiple servers over NATS
* [Control subscriptions](docs/tech/controlsubs.md) - Subscriptions that all microservices implement out of the box on port `:888`
* [Environment variables](docs/tech/envars.md) - Environment variables used to initialize microservices
