## üöå Introduction

`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages NATS, a messaging bus, for communications among microservices. Microservices over a bus = microbus.

The framework's philosophy can be categorized into three conceptual areas:

* Common runtime - The framework specifies rules that all microservices need to comply with during runtime. This includes things like how microservices [communicate](./docs/tech/unicast.md), how they report [metrics](./docs/structure/coreservices-metrics.md), where they [pull config values](./docs/tech/configuration.md) from, how they output logs, how they get deployed, etc. A common set of rules is important for interoperability, maintainability and stability of the system
* RAD tools - The framework leverages [code generation](./docs/tech/codegen.md) for the rapid development of microservices with the intent that application developers focus on the business logic rather than on boilerplate code. Developer productivity is directly correlated to customer value
* Standard building blocks - Capabilities that are deemed to be the building blocks of microservices are implemented by the framework in a standard way, serving to facilitate both of the above

`fabric` is the main project that provides the basic capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices are built upon. The [milestones](./docs/milestones.md) of this project are maintained in separate branches in order to archive and demonstrate the development process of the framework and the evolution of the codebase.

## üö¶ Getting Started

üëâ Follow the [quick start guide](./docs/quick-start.md) to set up your system and run the example app.

üëâ Go through the [examples](./docs/structure/examples.md) in depth.

üëâ Follow the step-by-step guide and [build your first microservice](./docs/first-service.md)!

üëâ Discover the full power of [code generation](./docs/tech/codegen.md). It's totally RAD, dude!

üëâ Learn how to write thorough [integration tests](./docs/tech/integrationtesting.md) and achieve high code coverage.

üëâ Venture out and [explore more on your own](./docs/self-explore.md).

## üßÖ Layers

Onions have layers, ogres have layers, and so does any good piece of software.
