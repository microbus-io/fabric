# Microbus.io fabric : Milestone 8

<img src="docs\gopher-on-bus.png" width=256>

## Introduction

`Microbus` is an opinionated framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages NATS, a messaging bus, for communications among microservices.

The framework gets involved in three conceptual areas:

* Common runtime - The framework specifies rules that all microservices need to adhere to in runtime. This includes things like how microservices communicate, how they report metrics, where they pull config values from, how they get deployed, etc. A common set of rules is important for proper interoperability and the stability of the system as a whole.
* RAD tools - The framework introduces tools for the rapid development of microservices. The intent is for application developers to be able to focus on application business logic rather than boilerplate code. Developer productivity is directly correlated to customer value.
* Building blocks - Certain capabilities that are the building blocks of microservices are standardized and provided by the framework. These serve to facilitate both of the above.

`fabric` is the main project that provides the core capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices are built on. The [milestones](docs/milestones.md) of this project are maintained in separate branches in order to demonstrate the thinking process behind the building of this framework.

## Quick Start

[Get started quickly](docs/quick-start.md) by setting up your system and running the examples.

## Code Structure

Review each of the major project packages to get oriented in the code structure:

* [application](docs/structure/application.md) - A collector of microservices that run in a single process and share the same lifecycle
* [cb](docs/structure/cb.md) - Options for callbacks
* [cfg](docs/structure/cb.md) <sup color="orange">new</sup> - Options for defining config properties
* [clock](docs/structure/clock.md) - An abstraction of the functions in the standard library time package to allow for mocking
* [connector](docs/structure/connector.md) - The primary construct of the framework and the basis for all microservices
* [errors](docs/structure/errors.md) - An enhancement of Go's standard `errors` package 
* [examples](docs/structure/examples.md) - Demo microservices 
* [frag](docs/structure/frag.md) - Means to break large HTTP requests and responses into fragments that can then be reassembled
* [frame](docs/structure/frame.md) - A utility for type-safe manipulation of the HTTP control headers used by the framework
* [log](docs/structure/log.md) - Fields for attaching data to log messages
* [pub](docs/structure/pub.md) - Options for publishing requests
* [rand](docs/structure/rand.md) - A utility for generating random numbers
* [services/configurator](docs/structure/services-configurator.md) - The configurator system microservice
* [services/httpingress](docs/structure/services-httpingress.md) - The HTTP ingress proxy system microservice
* [sub](docs/structure/sub.md) - Options for subscribing to handle requests
* [utils](docs/structure/utils.md) - Various independent utility classes and functions

## Technical Deep Dive

Go into the details with these technical guides:

* [Unicast messaging](docs/tech/unicast.md) - Unicast enables bi-directional (request and response) HTTP-like messaging between a client and a single server over NATS
* [HTTP ingress](docs/tech/httpingress.md) - The reason for and role of the HTTP ingress proxy service
* [Encapsulation pattern](docs/tech/encapsulation.md) - The reasons for encapsulating third-party technologies
* [Error capture](docs/tech/errorcapture.md) - How and why errors are captured and propagated across microservices boundaries
* [Time budget](docs/tech/timebudget.md) - The proper way to manage request timeouts
* [Configuration](docs/tech/configuration.md) <sup color="orange">updated</sup> - How to configure microservices
* [NATS connection settings](docs/tech/natsconnection.md) <sup color="orange">updated</sup> - How to configure microservices to connect and authenticate to NATS
* [Multicast messaging](docs/tech/multicast.md) - Extending on the unicast pattern, multicast enables bi-directional (request and response) HTTP-like messaging between a client and multiple servers over NATS
* [Control subscriptions](docs/tech/controlsubs.md) - Subscriptions that all microservices implement out of the box on port `:888`
* [Environment variables](docs/tech/envars.md) <sup color="orange">new</sup> - Environment variables used to initialize microservices
